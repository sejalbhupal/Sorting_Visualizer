Sorting Visualizer – Web Development Project

This project is an interactive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work in real time. It provides an engaging way to understand the internal process of algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort through animated and color-coded bars.

The project features a clean and modern glassmorphism-based user interface with gradient effects and smooth transitions. Users can generate new arrays of customizable sizes, adjust sorting speed, and observe the step-by-step visualization of each algorithm. The design is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

This project enhances understanding of sorting algorithms and demonstrates practical knowledge of DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and advanced CSS design principles. It serves as an excellent portfolio project for showcasing skills in frontend development, algorithm visualization, and user interface design.
